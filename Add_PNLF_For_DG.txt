# Maintained by: Olderst for: Brightness Patches
# Add_PNLF_For_DG.txt
# 
# Created by Den Skop 
# Design by Olderst
#
# This patch enables the brightness slider in SysPrefs->Displays
# and will also enable activation of sleep mode by closing
# the laptop lid.
#
# This patch works well for laptops that have working
# Radeon/nVidia Discrete Graphics.
#
# Based on information from the normal laptop DSDT methods,
# optimized for use with ACPIBacklight.kext
#
# Note: This patch should be applied to the DSDT that defines
# your discrete graphics device (always at _ADR 0x00010000).
